## MedTWIN Developers

Welcome to the MedTWIN developer portal.

### Products
- **Rubric Gates (as a service)**: evaluate artifacts/specs and receive **verifiable certificates** (approve/revise/block).

### What we will not claim
- This API is not medical advice and does not provide patient-level treatment recommendations.
- We do not claim clinical outcome improvements (mortality/LOS/treatment benefit).
