## Rubric Gates (overview)

Rubric Gates treats trust as a **verifiable artifact**:
every response is accompanied by a **certificate** (gate report + provenance metadata).

### Rubric tiers
- **Tier 1 (constitution)**: determinism, audit trail completeness, privacy constraints
- **Tier 2 (clinical invariants)**: units/ranges, temporal coherence, leakage prevention
- **Tier 3 (task benchmarks)**: executable specs + measurable agreement with references
